# Argulint
Tired of your linter not making you feel like the terrible developer you really are? Welcome.

## Contributing

PRs fully welcome, come up with some sick nasty messaging combos, improve the linter, or whatever!

This project follows the [JS Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) guidelines

## What

Argulint is a small module that you can pipe data into from the [`standardjs`](https://standardjs.com/) module.

It will then take the output and convert it into a more... Argulint esk manner to print to the terminal.

## TODO

- Convert the data piped into argulint responses
- Give that data back to the interface
