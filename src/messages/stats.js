// These messages are built for the stats log
// As usual please follow the rules:
// Rule #1: Nothing with the obvious "extreme" curse words. Small stuff like "hell" are okay
// Rule #2: No straight out hate speech/derogitory remarks keep the insult obvious in it's jokey meaning
// For instance: Don't mock someones Gender, Weight, or Sexuality (These are just 3 examples)
// Rule #3: Please when adding new insults keep the arrays alphabetized
