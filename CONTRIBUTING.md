# Contributing

PRs fully welcome, come up with some sick nasty messaging combos, improve the linter, or whatever!

This project follows the [JS Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/) guidelines

## Rules

Please follow these simple rules, those who do not their PRs will be instantly declined.

1. Nothing with the obvious "extreme" curse words. Small stuff like "hell" are okay
2. No straight out hate speech/derogitory remarks keep the insult obvious in it's jokey meaning
3. Please when adding new insults keep the arrays alphabetized

I am hoping that you use common sense when building insults, remember this is all fun in games.

## Changing Code

So obviously you can also open PRs to help improve and adjust the code that actually builds and presents the messaging, please stick to the standard style guidelines, as well as the Functional Programming design pattern. Thanks!
